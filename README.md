# Predictive-Analysis-on-Canadian-Drug-Shortages

## Project Overview

This project addresses the critical issue of drug shortages in Canada, leveraging machine learning techniques to predict shortages based on various factors such as supply chain dynamics, manufacturing disruptions, regulatory changes, and demand fluctuations. 

## Motivation 

As a Pharmacy Technician, I experience firsthand the challenges of managing medication supples or finding alternatives during when a drug becomes unavailable. This not only affects the pharmacy, but more importantly it critically impacts patient well-being as some of them depends on their medication. 

With over 20,573 unique drugs were reported using Drug Shortages Canada website as of November 2023. This project aims to develop a robust solution that helps mitigate this ongoing problem through predictive modeling. 

## Dataset 

The dataset was exported from Drug Shortages Canada's historical record feature; which is the official platform for reporting and accessing data on drug shortages and discontinuations in Canada. This data is maintained by markert authorization holders and is publicly accessible.
